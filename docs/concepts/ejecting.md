# Ejecting

To stop from using projen to manage your project configuration,
you can `eject` at any time and continue to manage your configuration manually.

Running `projen eject` will do the following:

- uninstall projen as a project dependency
- change projen-managed files from readonly to user-writeable
- remove "Generated by projen" markers from projen-generated files
- remove projen metadata files
- remove the projen synthesis step from the `build` task
- remove the `default` and `eject` tasks
- "backup" projenrc files to `.projenrc.xyz.bak`
- a separate task runner file is added to the root directory (see Tasks below
  for more information)

You do not need to ever use `eject`, but the option is available if the means of
customization provided by projen are no longer suitable your project.

## Tasks

A script will be added to your project so that you can continue using existing
tasks by running `scripts/run-task.cjs <task>` in your command line (or running `npm
run <task>` in node-based projects) if you so choose. You must retain the
`tasks.json` file found in the `.projen/` folder to use the task runner.

> Note: it is possible some tasks may not work after projen is ejected due to
the use of projen "builtin" steps. See
https://github.com/projen/projen/issues/1563 for more information.
