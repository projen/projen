   *
   * ## Automatically merging a set of Stacked PRs
   *
   * If you set this to `['main']` you can automatically merge a set of Stacked PRs
   * in the right order. It works like this:
   *
   * - Create PR #1 from branch `a`, targeting `main`.
   * - Create PR #2 from branch `b`, targeting branch `a`.
   * - Create PR #3 from branch `c`, targeting branch `b`.
   *
   * Initially, PR #1 will be set to auto-merge, PRs #2 and #3 will not.
   *
   * Once PR #1 passes all of its requirements it will merge. That will delete
   * branch `a` and change  the target branch of PR #2 change to `main`. At that
   * point, auto-queueing will switch on for PR #2 and it gets merged, etc.
   *
   * > [!IMPORTANT]
   * > This component will never disable AutoMerge, only enable it. So if a PR is
   * > initially targeted at one of the branches in this list, and then
   * > subsequently retargeted to another branch, *AutoMerge is not
   * > automatically turned off*.
